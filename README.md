# SQL_Task-5

## SQL Joins (EMP & DEPT Tables)

### Description:
This task demonstrates the use of SQL **JOINs** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER) to combine and analyze data from two related tables: `EMP` (employees) and `DEPT` (departments). We use different types of joins to retrieve employee and department details, even when some data is missing.

### Key Concepts:
- INNER JOIN: Returns only matching records from both tables
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched ones from the right
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched ones from the left
- FULL OUTER JOIN (simulated): Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOIN to include all records
